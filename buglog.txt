************************************ checkpoint 1 ***************************
bug: game black screen
time worked: 3 days ish 
notes: using strcpy with a char pointer in modex.c does some FUNKY stuff, I guess. changing that solved everything

bug: screen had weird colors and weren't images but a bunch of random lines that vaguely looks like correct image
time worked: 6 hours ish 
notes: had to make sure and make all variables the right type and length so no overflow occurs. 

bug: LED decimal not printing
time worked: a couple hours 
notes: had to rework the logic to add 0x10 to the buffer 

bug: moving the image would be laggy and it would jump a lot. also would show random colors at the edges
time worked: 5 hours
notes: had to make global variables for the buttons pressed in input.c and some small logic stuff for synchronization 
        code given in the disucssion slides

bug: holding A or B or C would spam the entering rooms command
time: 1 hour
notes: just compared the last button to current and do nothing if repeated A, B, or C button is received

bug: the left most LED would be the same as the 3rd. 
time 40 minutes:
notes: had to make make small changes to writing the LED buffer so it wouldn't skip LED that are turned offset

bug: the arrow keys on keyboard didn't work
time: 30 minutes
note: had to delete some if and else things in the given input.c that disabled the keyboard

bug: the arrow keys on keyboard would move the image and also type some letters
time: 30 minutes
note: had to delete a small block of code that did that in the given input.c
